ANALYSIS 001                                              April 21, 14:20 CET

This is the first time I have, to an extent, useful version of the scripts.
Maybe the first thing to try is to see what is the minimum solver tolerance
to be used.

I was running the case with algorithm "RC_Standard_From_Matrix".  It turns
out that residuals fall monothonically if residuals for momentum and pressure
are six orders of magnitude smaller than outer (SIMPLE) residuals.  (Four and
five orders of magnitude might pull it, but just.)

In any case, solver.par file which worked for the above case reads:

#--------[ time stepping related ]--------
# (1) dt,            time step
# (2) n_steps,       number of time steps
# (3) step_plot_int, unsteady results plotting interval (0 to skip)
   1.0e-1
1200
 100
#--------[ simple algorithm related ]--------
# (4) n_iters,       number of iterations in simple algorithm
# (5) iter_plot_int, iteration plotting interval (0 to skip)
# (6) o_tol,         outer iteration tolerance
   6
   0
   1.0e-6
#--------[ momentum equation related ]--------
# (7) urf_u,   under-relaxation factor for momentum
# (8) u_iters, number of iterations for momentum solver
# (9) tol_u,   tolerance for momentum solver
   0.7
  60
   1.0e-12
#--------[ pressure equation related ]--------
# (10) urf_p,   under-relaxation factor for pressure
# (11) p_iters, number of iterations for pressure solver
# (12) tol_p,  tolerance for pressure solver
   0.3
  60
   1.0e-12

OK, wanna try the other algorythms with above settings to see if they will
converge too.

a) Trying with "Linear_From_Velocities".  This failed to converge.  Please
   the convergence history in: analysis_001_a_linear_from_velocities.png

b) Trying with "Linear_From_matrix".  This also failed to converge.  Please
   the convergence history in: analysis_001_b_linear_from_matrix.png

c) Trying with "RC_Standard_From_Velocities".  This converged after 256 step.
   Convergence history is in: analysis_001_c_rc_standard_from_velocities.png

d) Trying with "RC_Standard_From_Matrix".  This converged after 256 step.
   Convergence history is in: analysis_001_d_rc_standard_from_matrix.png

OK, fine.  What this analysis showed is that:

1. There are very small differences in interpolations "from velocities" and
   "from matrix".  The latter one seems to give more control over the
   algorithm, I think, so I considered it the preferred option for the
   time being.

2. Solutions with linear interpolations are very slow to converge.  Although
   the amplitude of oscialltions they create is not bigger than with Rhie
   and Chow, this is not the way to continue, really.

3. The results are rather strange and worrissome to extent.  The final results
   for analysis b) and d) are in figures:
   analysis_001_e_results_linear_from_matrix.png, and
   analysis_001_f_results_rc_standard_from_matrix.png

This will all be tagged as revision "analysis_001".
