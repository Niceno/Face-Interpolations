Let's think about forces due to phase change.

Now, the question was: shall I see phase change as a force in the first place?
I would say: heck yes!  How else does a steam engine works if it wasn't using
boiling and increase in volume as a force which drives the pistons?

OK, said that, let's check the units a little bit.

area:             A                    ...  m^2

force:            f                    ...  N = kg m / s^2

pressure:         p = f/A              ...  N / m^2 = kg / (m s^2)

mass transfer:    m_dot                ...  kg / s

volume transfer:  v_dot = m_dot / rho  ...  m^3 / s

velocity          u = v_dot / A        ...  m / s

----------------------------------------------------------------

Guess:

f = m_dot * u  ... kg/s * m/s = kg m / s^2 = N

In addition, m_dot is constant for a system (or given for a system), but
v_dot depends on the phase, it is much larger in steam than in water, since
density of steam is so much smaller.

That means that force excerted by mass transfer won't be the same at each
of the phases.  (In numerical sense, it won't be the same at each of the
cells surrounding a face at which mass transfer takes place.)

v_dot_steam = m_dot / rho_steam
v_dot_water = m_dot / rho_water

f_water = m_dot * u_water = m_dot^2 / rho_water / A  ... kg m / s^2

f_steam = m_dot * u_steam = m_dot^2 / rho_steam / A  ... kg m / s^2

and they both act in the same direction.  That might sound a bit confusing
at first, but imagine an interface at which mass transfer takes place, say
boiling:


         water                              steam
                               |
                               |
         v_dot_water, small => | ==========> v_dot_steam, big
      (sucks from the left)    |             (pushes to the right)
                               |
                          ---------->  m_dot
                               |
                           =-> | =-------------> u_steam, big and
         u_water, small yet    |                 goes to the right
         goes to the right     |
                               |

How stupid was to think that there are two forces?  There can be only one
force at the interface, and that force is excerted on both phases.  This
unique force could have the form:

f = m_dot * (u_steam - u_water)  ... kg/s * m/s = kg m / s^2 = N

u_steam - u_water = m_dot / rho_steam - m_dot / rho_water

u_steam - u_water = m_dot * (1/ rho_steam - 1/ rho_water)

f = m_dot^2 * (1/ rho_steam - 1/ rho_water) / A  ...  kg m / s^2 = N

Numerically, this could be the force we define at faces, and then
distribute over cells, like we do with other forces in proper collocated
finite volume approach.

Also numerically, linear system of discretized momentum equations has
the form:

[M]{u} = {f}  ...  [N]

where:

M  ...  kg / s
u  ...  m / s
f  ...  kg m / s^2 = N

meaning that u = f / M

So, to get volume fluxes on cell faces in Rhie and Chow, one multiplies
forces and divides them with diagonals of matrix coefficients.

M_steam ~ rho_steam * vol / dt  ...  kg / s, and is small
M_water ~ rho_water * vol / dt  ...  kg / s, and is BIG

The coefficients in Rhie and Chow, which are computed as vol/M are:

vol / M_steam  ...  m^3 s / kg, and is BIG
vol / M_water  ...  m^3 s / kg, and is small
